# Folk Atlas

Folk Atlas is an interactive web application that lets you explore folk melodies from various countries. Select a country to hear a traditional folk melody, change the scale and tonality, and see the characteristic drum pattern being played through the rhytmhic wheel. Additionally, enjoy a fun game where you can guess the country a song belongs to, available in both single-player and multiplayer modes!

## Map

Exploring the map is very easy and intuitive. 
There are folk songs from 9 countries: Italy, France, Spain, United Kingdom, Austria, USA, Jamaica, Brazil and Australia.

Click on a marker and a popup will show up: 
- At the top there's the song title with a brief description of the tradition it comes from.
- On the left, you’ll find the rhythmic wheel, which displays the distinctive drum pattern.
- In the middle, a progress bar indicates the loop's progress. Additionally, there are four mute buttons, one for each instrument, which can be activated by clicking on them.
- On the right, a circle of fifths is displayed, allowing you to select the song's tonality, along with a dropdown menu for choosing the scale.

## Game


Clicking the button at the top left of the page lets you play a game where you guess which song belongs to which country. You can play solo or challenge a friend. To play in multiplayer mode, you need to create a lobby or join an existing one. All lobby names are displayed below and can be easily copied and pasted.

</p>

When the game starts, the rhythmic wheel appears: click "Play" to hear the song and "Select" to choose the country. Be careful—once you click "Select," you can't replay the song or see the rhythmic pattern again!

If you recognize the drum pattern immediately, you'll be the fastest among your friends and likely win the game! For each correct answer, you earn 1 point; for each wrong answer, you lose 1 point. Reach -3 points and you lose; reach 5 points and you win!
